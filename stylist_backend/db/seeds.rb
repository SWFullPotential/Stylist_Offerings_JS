# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# Hairstylist.create(name: "Samantha", year_licensed: 2013)

# not yet seeded. 
# Hairservice.create(service_name: "haircut")
# Hairservice.create(service_name: "blow-out")
# Hairservice.create(service_name: "full highlight")
# Hairservice.create(service_name: "partial highlight")
